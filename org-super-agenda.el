;;; org-super-agenda.el --- Supercharge your agenda  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; Url: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda
;; Version: 1.2-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1") (s "1.10.0") (dash "2.13") (org "9.0") (ht "2.2") (ts "0.2"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines, Org, agenda

;;; Commentary:

;; This package lets you "supercharge" your Org daily/weekly agenda.
;; The idea is to group items into sections, rather than having them
;; all in one big list.

;; Now you can sort-of do this already with custom agenda commands,
;; but when you do that, you lose the daily/weekly aspect of the
;; agenda: items are no longer shown based on deadline/scheduled
;; timestamps, but are shown no-matter-what.

;; So this package filters the results from
;; `org-agenda-finalize-entries', which runs just before items are
;; inserted into agenda views.  It runs them through a set of filters
;; that separate them into groups.  Then the groups are inserted into
;; the agenda buffer, and any remaining items are inserted at the end.
;; Empty groups are not displayed.

;; The end result is your standard daily/weekly agenda, but arranged
;; into groups defined by you.  You might put items with certain tags
;; in one group, habits in another group, items with certain todo
;; keywords in another, and items with certain priorities in another.
;; The possibilities are only limited by the grouping functions.

;; The primary use of this package is for the daily/weekly agenda,
;; made by the `org-agenda-list' command, but it also works for other
;; agenda views, like `org-tags-view', `org-todo-list',
;; `org-search-view', etc.

;; Here's an example which you can test by evaluating the `let' form:

;; (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
;;        '(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors.
;;          (:name "Today" ; Optionally specify section name
;;                 :time-grid t ; Items that appear on the time grid
;;                 :todo "TODAY") ; Items that have this TODO keyword
;;          (:name "Important"
;;                 ;; Single arguments given alone
;;                 :tag "bills"
;;                 :priority "A")
;;          ;; Set order of multiple groups at once
;;          (:order-multi (2 (:name "Shopping in town"
;;                                  ;; Boolean AND group matches items that match all subgroups
;;                                  :and (:tag "shopping" :tag "@town"))
;;                           (:name "Food-related"
;;                                  ;; Multiple args given in list with implicit OR
;;                                  :tag ("food" "dinner"))
;;                           (:name "Personal"
;;                                  :habit t
;;                                  :tag "personal")
;;                           (:name "Space-related (non-moon-or-planet-related)"
;;                                  ;; Regexps match case-insensitively on the entire entry
;;                                  :and (:regexp ("space" "NASA")
;;                                                ;; Boolean NOT also has implicit OR between selectors
;;                                                :not (:regexp "moon" :tag "planet")))))

;;          (:todo "WAITING" :order 8) ; Set order of this section
;;          (:todo ("SOMEDAY" "TO-READ" "CHECK" "TO-WATCH" "WATCHING")
;;                 ;; Show this group at the end of the agenda (since it has the
;;                 ;; highest number). If you specified this group last, items
;;                 ;; with these todo keywords that e.g. have priority A would be
;;                 ;; displayed in that group instead, because items are grouped
;;                 ;; out in the order the groups are listed.

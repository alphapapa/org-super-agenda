* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore
:END:

This package lets you "supercharge" your Org daily/weekly agenda.  The idea is to group items into sections, rather than having them all in one big list.

Now you can sort-of do this already with custom agenda commands, but when you do that, you lose the daily/weekly aspect of the agenda: items are no longer shown based on deadline/scheduled timestamps, but are shown no-matter-what.

So this package filters the results from ~org-agenda-finalize-entries~, which runs just before items are inserted into agenda views.  It runs them through a set of filters that separate them into groups.  Then the groups are inserted into the agenda buffer, and any remaining items are inserted at the end.  Empty groups are not displayed.

The end result is your standard daily/weekly agenda, but arranged into groups defined by you.  You might put items with certain tags in one group, habits in another group, items with certain todo keywords in another, and items with certain priorities in another.  The possibilities are only limited by the grouping functions.

The primary use of this package is for the daily/weekly agenda, made by the ~org-agenda-list~ command, but it also works for other agenda views, like ~org-tags-view~, ~org-todo-list~, ~org-search-view~, etc.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

** MELPA

Just install the =org-super-agenda= package!

** Manual installation

If you want to install manually, you must also install these packages:

+  Emacs >= 26.1
+  =dash= >= 2.13
+  =ht= >=2.2
+  =org-mode= >= 9.0
+  =s= >= 1.10
+  =ts=

Then put =org-super-agenda.el= in your =load-path=, and eval =(require 'org-super-agenda)=.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      1
:END:

1.  Enable ~org-super-agenda-mode~.
2.  Set the variable ~org-super-agenda-groups~ as desired (see example below). 

    *Note:* In order for groups to be automatically, persistently applied to all agenda buffers, the variable ~org-super-agenda-groups~ /must be set in the global scope/ (e.g. with ~setq~ in your init file, or using the customization interface).  Alternatively, it can be ~let~-bound in lisp code that calls ~org-agenda~ commands, but in that case, the setting /will not persist across agenda commands/ (so after refreshing an agenda buffer by pressing =g=, there will be no groups).
3.  Run an Org agenda command.
4.  Start the day with confidence, knowing that nothing important has been lost in the jumble of /ahem/ overdue items.

** Examples

At first you might feel bewildered by all the options.  Never fear, [[examples.org][examples]] are here!

Here's the code for the screenshots above.  You can test it quickly by evaluating this code block:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors.

                  :todo "TODAY")  ; Items that have this TODO keyword
           (:name "Important"
                  ;; Single arguments given alone

                                   ;; Multiple args given in list with implicit OR
                                   :tag ("food" "dinner"))
                            (:name "Personal"

                                   :tag "personal")
                            (:name "Space-related (non-moon-or-planet-related)"

                                                 ;; Boolean NOT also has implicit OR between selectors
                                                 :not (:regexp "moon" :tag "planet")))))
           ;; Groups supply their own section names when none are given
           (:todo "WAITING" :order 8)  ; Set order of this section
           (:todo ("SOMEDAY" "TO-READ" "CHECK" "TO-WATCH" "WATCHING")
                  ;; Show this group at the end of the agenda (since it has the
                  ;; highest number). If you specified this group last, items
                  ;; with these todo keywords that e.g. have priority A would be
                  ;; displayed in that group instead, because items are grouped
                  ;; out in the order the groups are listed.
                  :order 9)
           (:priority<= "B"
                        ;; Show this section after "Today" and "Important", because

                        :order 1)

           ;; match any of these groups, with the default order position of 99
           )))
    (org-agenda nil "a"))
#+END_SRC

The groups apply to all agenda commands (at least, every one that calls ~org-agenda-finalize-entries~).  You can set different groups for custom commands by setting ~org-super-agenda-groups~ in the custom command's ~settings~ list (see the description for ~org-agenda-custom-commands~).  You can disable grouping by binding ~org-super-agenda-groups~ to nil around a call to an agenda command, or you can disable it globally by disabling the mode.

** Group selectors

Each group selector takes an argument which can be a single atom or a list, e.g. ~:tag~ takes a string or list of strings.  Some selectors are predicates, like ~:deadline~ or ~:habit~; for consistency, they also take an argument, but it is ignored.  

A group selector creates a section in the agenda containing the items it matches, and any items it doesn't match are passed to the next group selector.

~:discard~ is a special exception to this: it simply discards any items it matches, and passes through the rest to the next group selector.

Note that the ~:not~ group selector /creates/ a group with items it /does not/ match; it can be combined with ~:discard~ to discard items that /don't/ match, e.g. ~(:discard (:not (:priority "A")))~ as the first selector would mean that only priority ~A~ items would appear in the agenda, while ~(:discard (:priority "C"))~ would mean that any priority ~C~ items would not appear in the agenda.

*** Keywords

+  =:name= :: Optionally, set group name header.   May be a string; or the symbol ~none~, in which case no header will be inserted.  If ~:name~ is not set at all, the group will be named automatically.
+  ~:face~ :: A /face/ to apply to items in the group.  If /face/ is a plist containing ~:append t~, it will be appended.  See function ~add-face-text-property~.
+  ~:transformer~ :: Used to transform item strings before display.  Either a function called with one argument, the item string, or a sexp, in which case the item string is bound to ~it~.

*** Special selectors

Every selector requires an argument, even if it's just ~t~, e.g. ~:anything~, ~:auto-category~, ~:auto-group~, and ~:discard~.

+  =:and= :: Group ITEMS that match all selectors in GROUP.
+  =:anything= :: Select every item, no matter what.  This is probably most useful with ~:discard~, because it doesn't actually test anything, so it's faster than, e.g. ~:regexp "."~, which has to get the entry text for every item.
+  =:auto-category= :: This automatically groups items by their category (usually the filename it's in, without the =.org= suffix).
+  ~:auto-dir-name~ :: This automatically groups items by the directory name of their source buffer.
+  =:auto-group= :: This selects items that have the =agenda-group= Org property set.  By setting this property for a subtree, every item in it will be sorted into an agenda group by that name and placed into the agenda where the ~:auto-group~ selector is ([[examples.org#automatically-by-group][example]]).
+  ~:auto-map~ :: This automatically groups items by the value returned when applying each item to the given function as a string from the agenda buffer ([[examples.org#automatically-by-mapping-a-function][example]]).  The function should return a string to be used as the grouping key and as the header for its group.
+  =:auto-outline-path= :: This automatically groups items by their outline path hierarchy, like =Plans/Take over the universe/Take over the moon=.
+  ~:auto-parent~ :: This automatically groups items by their parent heading.  This is surprisingly handy, especially if you group tasks hierarchically by project and use agenda restrictions to limit the agenda to a subtree.
+  =:auto-planning= :: This automatically groups items by their earliest of scheduled date or deadline, formatted according to variable ~org-super-agenda-date-format~.
+  =:auto-priority= :: This automatically groups items by their priority.
+  ~:auto-property~ :: This automatically groups items by the value of the given property ([[examples.org#automatically-by-property][example]]).
+  =:auto-tags= :: This automatically groups items by all of their tags (i.e. items with exactly the same tags, in any order, will be grouped together).
+  =:auto-todo= :: This automatically groups items by their to-do keyword.
+  ~:auto-ts~ :: This automatically groups items by the date of their latest timestamp anywhere in the entry, formatted according to variable ~org-super-agenda-date-format~.
+  =:discard= :: Discard items that match selectors.  Any groups processed after this one will not see discarded items.  You might use this at the beginning or end of a list of groups, either to narrow down the list of items (used in combination with ~:not~), or to exclude items you're not interested in.
+  =:not= :: Group ITEMS that match no selectors in GROUP.
+  =:order= :: A number setting the order sections will be displayed in the agenda, lowest number first.  Defaults to =0=.
+  =:order-multi= :: Set the order of multiple groups at once, like ~(:order-multi (2 (groupA) (groupB) ...))~ to set the order of these groups to 2.

*** Normal selectors

These selectors take one argument alone, or multiple arguments in a list. 

+  =:category= :: Group items that match any of the given categories.  Argument may be a string or list of strings.
+  =:children= :: Select any item that has child entries.  Argument may be ~t~ to match if it has any children, ~nil~ to match if it has no children, ~todo~ to match if it has children with any to-do keywords, or a string to match if it has children with certain to-do keywords.  You might use this to select items that are project top-level headings.  Be aware that this may be very slow in non-daily/weekly agenda views because of its recursive nature.
+  =:date= :: Group items that have a date associated. Argument can be =t= to match items with any date, =nil= to match items without a date, or =today= to match items with today’s date. The =ts-date= text-property is matched against.
+  =:deadline= :: Group items that have a deadline. Argument can be ~t~ (to match items with any deadline), ~nil~ (to match items that have no deadline), ~past~ (to match items with a deadline in the past), ~today~ (to match items whose deadline is today), or ~future~ (to match items with a deadline in the future). Argument may also be given like ~before DATE~ or ~after DATE~ where DATE is a date string that ~org-time-string-to-absolute~ can process.
+  =:effort<= :: Group items that are less than (or equal to) the given effort. Argument is a time-duration string, like ~5~ or ~0:05~ for 5 minutes.
+  =:effort>= :: Group items that are higher than (or equal to) the given effort. Argument is a time-duration string, like ~5~ or ~0:05~ for 5 minutes.
+  ~:file-path~ :: Group items whose buffers' filename paths match any of the given regular expressions.
+  =:habit= :: Group habit items (items which have a =STYLE: habit= Org property).
+  =:heading-regexp= :: Group items whose headings match any of the given regular expressions.
+  =:log= :: Group Agenda Log Mode items.  Argument may be ~close~ or ~closed~ to select items closed today; ~clock~ or ~clocked~ to select items clocked today; ~changed~ or ~state~ to select items whose to-do state was changed today; ~t~ to select any logged item, or ~nil~ to select any non-logged item.  (See also variable ~org-agenda-log-mode-items~.)  Note that these items may also be matched by the ~:time-grid~ selector, so if you want these displayed in their own group, you may need to select them in a group before a group containing the ~:time-grid~ selector.
+  ~:pred~ :: Group items if any of the given predicate functions return non-nil when called with each item as a string from the agenda buffer ([[examples.org#by-predicate][example]]).
+  =:priority= :: Group items that match any of the given priorities.  Argument may be a string or list of strings, which should be the priority letter, e.g. ~A~.
+  =:priority>= :: Group items that are higher than the given priority, e.g. ~C~.
+  =:priority>== :: Group items that are higher than or equal to the given priority, e.g. ~B~.
+  =:priority<= :: Group items that are lower than the given priority, e.g. ~A~.
+  =:priority<== :: Group items that are lower than or equal to the given priority, e.g. ~B~.
+  =:regexp= :: Group items that match any of the given regular expressions.
+  =:scheduled= :: Group items that are scheduled.  Argument can be ~t~ (to match items scheduled for any date), ~nil~ (to match items that are not schedule), ~past~ (to match items scheduled for the past), ~today~ (to match items scheduled for today), or ~future~ (to match items scheduled for the future).  Argument may also be given like ~before DATE~ or ~after DATE~ where DATE is a date string that ~org-time-string-to-absolute~ can process.
+  =:tag= :: Group items that match any of the given tags.  Argument may be a string or list of strings.
+  =:time-grid= :: Group items that appear on the time grid.
+  =:todo= :: Group items that match any of the given TODO keywords.  Argument may be a string or list of strings, or ~t~ to match any keyword, or ~nil~ to match only non-todo items.

** Tips

+  An [[info:org-super-agenda][info page]] is included, with the contents of this readme file.
+  Group headers use the keymap =org-super-agenda-header-map=, allowing you to bind keys in that map which will take effect when point is on a header.
     -  For example, [[https://github.com/gregsexton/origami.el][origami]] works with =org-super-agenda= buffers without any extra configuration.  Just activate =origami-mode= in the agenda buffer and use the command =origami-toggle-node= to fold groups.  You can bind, e.g. =TAB= to that command in the header map, and then you can easily collapse groups as if they were an outline.  You might even fold some automatically ([[examples.org#automatically-fold-certain-groups-with-origami][example]]).

* FAQ
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

** Why are some items not displayed even though I used group selectors for them?

This is a common misunderstanding of how this package works.  As written in the introduction, it does not /collect/ items.  It only /groups/ items that are collected by Org Agenda or =org-ql=.  So if your Agenda command or =org-ql= query does not collect certain items, they will not be displayed, regardless of what =org-super-agenda= groups you configure.

[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]] provides an easier way to write queries to generate agenda-like views that can be grouped with =org-super-agenda=.

** Why did a group disappear when I moved it to the end of the list?

As explained in the usage instructions and shown in the example, items are collected into groups in the order the groups are listed, and empty groups are not shown.  To display a group out of the order in which groups are listed, use =:order=.

** 1.2-pre

*Added*
+  Selector ~:auto-planning~, which groups items by their earliest of scheduled date or deadline, formatted according to variable ~org-super-agenda-date-format~.

+  Selector =:auto-tags=, which groups items by all of their tags.
+  Option ~org-super-agenda-date-format~, used to format date headers in the ~:auto-date~ selector.
+  To-do keyword faces are applied to keywords in group headers.
+  Option =org-super-agenda-header-separator= may also be a character, which is automatically repeated to the window width.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/sheepduke][YUE Daian]].)
+  Option =org-super-agenda-header-properties=.  It sets =org-agenda-structural-header= by default, which enables navigating to headers with the default =M-{= / =M-}= bindings in agenda buffers.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/haji-ali][Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali]].)

*Changed*
+  Group headers face is now appended to face list instead of overriding it.
+  Minimum Emacs version requirement is now 26.1 (required by =ts= library).

*Fixed*
+  =:children todo= group selection ([[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda/issues/75][#75]]).  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/bleggett][Ben Leggett]] and [[https://github.com/whirm][Elric Milon]].)
+  =:children= group headings.
+  Don't show blank lines for disabled headers (i.e. with ~:name none~ and =org-super-agenda-header-separator= set to an empty string).  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda/issues/105][#105]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/floscr][Florian Schrödl]].)

*Updated*
+  Tests updated for Org 9.2.4.

Contributions and feedback are welcome.

If you find this useful, I'd appreciate if you would share a screenshot or two of your agenda views using it (minus any private data, of course).  I'd like to get ideas for how to better organize my agenda.  :)

** Bugs

+ The =org-search-view= agenda command does not seem to set the =todo-state= text property for items it finds, so the =:todo= selector doesn't work with it.  We should be able to work around this by getting the todo state for each item manually, but we have to make sure that we only do that when necessary, otherwise it might be slow.  And I wouldn't be surprised if there are other selectors that don't work with this or other commands, but =org-agenda-list= should work fine, and =org-tags-view= and =org-todo-list= seem to work.

** Tests

It's easy to run the tests:

1.  Install [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]].
2.  From the repo root directory, run =cask install=, which installs Emacs and package dependencies into the =.cask= directory.
3.  Run =make test=.

# NOTE: Setting org-comment-string buffer-locally is a nasty hack to work around GitHub's org-ruby's HTML rendering, which does not respect noexport tags.  The only way to hide this tree from its output is to use the COMMENT keyword, but that prevents Org from processing the export options declared in it.  So since these file-local variables don't affect org-ruby, wet set org-comment-string to an unused keyword, which prevents Org from deleting this tree from the export buffer, which allows it to find the export options in it.  And since org-export does respect the noexport tag, the tree is excluded from the info page.

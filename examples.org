* Examples 

There are a lot of possibilities, so here are some examples to spark your imagination.  Please do *share* your own examples by posting them on the issue tracker, and I will add them here.  It will be very helpful to others to see your creativity!

*Note:* You can test any of these examples by evaluating the whole =let= form in Emacs (or, if you open this file in Emacs, by executing the code block with =C-c C-c=).

** Automatically by group

By setting the Org property =agenda-group= and using the =:auto-group= selector, you can automatically sort agenda items into groups.  By default, this property is inherited, so you can set it for an entire subtree of items at once.  For example, if you had this Org file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Tasks
  ,** TODO Take over the universe
     DEADLINE: <2017-08-01 Tue>
  :PROPERTIES:
  :agenda-group: grandiose plans
  :END:
  ,*** TODO Take over the world
      DEADLINE: <2017-07-29 Sat>
  ,*** TODO Take over the moon
      DEADLINE: <2017-07-30 Sun>
  ,*** TODO Take over Mars
      DEADLINE: <2017-07-31 Mon>
  ,** Recurring
  :PROPERTIES:
  :agenda-group: recurring
  :END:

  ,*** TODO Pay Internet bill
      DEADLINE: <2017-07-28 Fri>
#+END_SRC

You could use an agenda command like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:auto-group t))))
    (org-agenda-list))
#+END_SRC

And you'd get an agenda looking like this:

[[screenshots/auto-group.png]]

The property name can be customized. This becomes handy if you already
have, for instance, an Org property named =ProjectId= attached to your
items. Instead of duplicating this Org property and renaming it to
=agenda-group=, you can set =org-super-agenda-group-property-name= to
an appropriate value:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-group-property-name "ProjectId")
        (org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:auto-group t))))
    (org-agenda-list))
#+END_SRC

This causes the =:auto-group= selector to sort your agenda items into
groups that reflect your =ProjectIds=.

** Automatically by category

In the same way, items can automatically be grouped by their category (which is usually the filename of the buffer they're in).

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:auto-category t))))
    (org-agenda-list))
#+END_SRC

** Forward-looking

Here's an example of a date-oriented, forward-looking agenda grouping.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:log t)  ; Automatically named "Log"
           (:name "Schedule"
                  :time-grid t)
           (:name "Today"
                  :scheduled today)
           (:habit t)
           (:name "Due today"
                  :deadline today)
           (:name "Overdue"
                  :deadline past)
           (:name "Due soon"
                  :deadline future)
           (:name "Unimportant"
                  :todo ("SOMEDAY" "MAYBE" "CHECK" "TO-READ" "TO-WATCH")
                  :order 100)
           (:name "Waiting..."
                  :todo "WAITING"
                  :order 98)
           (:name "Scheduled earlier"
                  :scheduled past))))
    (org-agenda-list))
#+END_SRC

** Log mode

When the agenda log mode is activated, these groups separate out tasks that you worked on or completed today.  The ~:order-multi~ sets the ~:order~ for each subgroup to ~1~, which makes it display below any groups without a defined ~:order~ (although there are no other groups in this example).

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:order-multi (1 (:name "Done today"
                                   :and (:regexp "State \"DONE\""
                                                 :log t))
                            (:name "Clocked today"
                                   :log t))))))
    (org-agenda-list))
#+END_SRC

If you'd prefer them at the top of the agenda, you could use this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:name "Done today"
                  :and (:regexp "State \"DONE\""
                                :log t))
           (:name "Clocked today"
                  :log t))))
    (org-agenda-list))
#+END_SRC

** Concrete dates

Let's say it's approaching the start of a new school year, and you want to see all tasks with a deadline before school starts.  You might use something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:deadline (before "2017-09-01"))
           (:discard (:anything t)))))
    (org-todo-list))
#+END_SRC

Of course, you could also write that as a standard agenda command with the  [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html][advanced searching syntax]], and it would execute faster.

What if you wanted to group tasks that are due before the end of the current month?  You could use something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (-let* (((sec minute hour day month year dow dst utcoff) (decode-time))
          (last-day-of-month (calendar-last-day-of-month month year))
          (target-date
           ;; A hack that seems to work fine.  Yay, Postel!
           (format "%d-%02d-%02d" year month (1+ last-day-of-month)))
          (org-super-agenda-groups
           `((:deadline (before ,target-date))
             (:discard (:anything t)))))
    (org-todo-list))
#+END_SRC

** Projects

With the =:children= selector you can select items that have children.  Assuming items without children aren't considered projects, you can view projects like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:name "Projects"
                  :children t)
           (:discard (:anything t)))))
    (org-todo-list))
#+END_SRC

You might want to put that at the end of a daily/weekly agenda view using a custom command that runs a series of agenda commands, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands
         '(("u" "Super view"
            ((agenda "" ((org-super-agenda-groups
                          '((:name "Today"
                                   :time-grid t)))))
             (todo "" ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects")
                       (org-super-agenda-groups
                        '((:name none  ; Disable super group header
                                 :children todo)
                          (:discard (:anything t)))))))))))
    (org-agenda nil "u"))
#+END_SRC

Note that the =:children= matcher may be quite slow in views like =org-todo-list= (i.e. the =todo= agenda command in the list above), especially if used to match to-do items.  It would be faster to use =org-agenda-skip-function=.  In a daily/weekly agenda it should perform well enough.

** Books to-read

This shows =TO-READ= to-do items with the tags =:book:= or =:books:=.  

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:discard (:not  ; Is it easier to read like this?
                      (:and
                       (:todo "TO-READ" :tag ("book" "books"))))))))
    (org-todo-list))
#+END_SRC

Remember that items that are not matched by a group selector fall through to the next selector or to the catch-all group.  So you might think that this simpler command would work:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:and (:todo "TO-READ" :tag ("book" "books"))))))
    (org-todo-list))
#+END_SRC

But while it would indeed group together those items, it would also display all other to-do items in the =Other items= section below, so you must =:discard= the items you don't want.  So another way to write this query would be to select the items you want and discard everything else:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:name "Books to read"
                  :and (:todo "TO-READ" :tag ("book" "books")))
           (:discard (:anything t)))))
    (org-todo-list))
#+END_SRC

Note that you could run part of this query with a standard agenda command, and it would be faster.  But since the =org-tags-view= and =org-todo-list= can only select by tags or todo-keywords, respectively, the other part of the selection must be done with grouping.  Here are two examples (note that they each produce the same results):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:discard (:not (:todo "TO-READ"))))))
    (org-tags-view nil "books|book"))

  ;; These commands produce the same results

  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:discard (:not (:tag ("book" "books")))))))
    (org-todo-list "TO-READ"))
#+END_SRC

Of course, the most canonical (and probably fastest) way to write this query is to use =org-search-view=, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (org-search-view t "+{:book\\|books:} +TO-READ")
#+END_SRC

Or if you're inputting the string manually after pressing =C-c a S=, you'd input =+{:book\|books:} +TO-READ=.  But if you're like me, and you forget the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html][advanced searching syntax]], you might find these more "lispy" grouping/selecting constructs easier to use, even if they can be slower on large datasets.  

And note that even if you use the built-in searching with =org-search-view=, you might still want to use this package to /group/ results, perhaps like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '((:name "Computer books"
                  :tag ("computer" "computers" "programming" "software"))
           ;; All other books would be displayed here
           )))
    (org-search-view t "+{:book\\|books:} +TO-READ"))
#+END_SRC

** Emacs and Org-mode to-do items

This shows all to-do items with the =:Emacs:= tag, and groups together anything related to Org.  You can see the use of the =rx= macro by backquoting the list and unquoting the =rx= form. 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results none
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         `((:name "Org-related"
                  :tag "Org"
                  :regexp ("org-mode"
                           ,(rx bow "org" eow))))))
    (org-tags-view t "Emacs"))
#+END_SRC

1 Introduction
**************

This package lets you "supercharge" your Org daily/weekly agenda.  The
idea is to group items into sections, rather than having them all in one
big list.

   Now you can sort-of do this already with custom agenda commands, but
when you do that, you lose the daily/weekly aspect of the agenda: items
are no longer shown based on deadline/scheduled timestamps, but are
shown no-matter-what.

   So this package filters the results from
‘org-agenda-finalize-entries’, which runs just before items are inserted
into agenda views.  It runs them through a set of filters that separate
them into groups.  Then the groups are inserted into the agenda buffer,
and any remaining items are inserted at the end.  Empty groups are not
displayed.

   The end result is your standard daily/weekly agenda, but arranged
into groups defined by you.  You might put items with certain tags in
one group, habits in another group, items with certain todo keywords in
another, and items with certain priorities in another.  The
possibilities are only limited by the grouping functions.

   The primary use of this package is for the daily/weekly agenda, made
by the ‘org-agenda-list’ command, but it also works for other agenda
views, like ‘org-tags-view’, ‘org-todo-list’, ‘org-search-view’, etc.

Just install the org-super-agenda package!


File: README.info,  Node: Manual installation,  Prev: MELPA,  Up: Installation

4.2 Manual installation
=======================

If you want to install manually, you must also install these packages:

   • Emacs >= 25.1
   • dash >= 2.13
   • ht >=2.2
   • org-mode >= 9.0
   • s >= 1.10

   Then put org-super-agenda.el in your load-path, and eval
(require 'org-super-agenda).


File: README.info,  Node: Usage,  Next: Changelog,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

5 Usage
*******

  1. Enable ‘org-super-agenda-mode’.
  2. Set the variable ‘org-super-agenda-groups’ as desired (see example
     below).  *Note:* In order for groups to be automatically applied to
     all agenda buffers, ‘org-super-agenda-groups’ must be set in the
     global scope (e.g.  with ‘setq’ in your init file, or using the
     customization interface).  It can also be ‘let’-bound in lisp code
     that calls ‘org-agenda’ commands.
  3. Run an Org agenda command.
  4. Start the day with confidence, knowing that nothing important has
     been lost in the jumble of _ahem_ overdue items.

5.1 Examples
============

At first you might feel bewildered by all the options.  Never fear, are
here!

   Here’s the code for the screenshots above.  You can test it quickly
by evaluating this code block:

     (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
            '(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors.
              (:name "Today"  ; Optionally specify section name
                     :time-grid t  ; Items that appear on the time grid
                     :todo "TODAY")  ; Items that have this TODO keyword
              (:name "Important"
                     ;; Single arguments given alone
                     :tag "bills"
                     :priority "A")
              ;; Set order of multiple groups at once
              (:order-multi (2 (:name "Shopping in town"
                                      ;; Boolean AND group matches items that match all subgroups
                                      :and (:tag "shopping" :tag "@town"))
                               (:name "Food-related"
                                      ;; Multiple args given in list with implicit OR
                                      :tag ("food" "dinner"))
                               (:name "Personal"
                                      :habit t
                                      :tag "personal")
                               (:name "Space-related (non-moon-or-planet-related)"
                                      ;; Regexps match case-insensitively on the entire entry
                                      :and (:regexp ("space" "NASA")
                                                    ;; Boolean NOT also has implicit OR between selectors
                                                    :not (:regexp "moon" :tag "planet")))))
              ;; Groups supply their own section names when none are given
              (:todo "WAITING" :order 8)  ; Set order of this section
              (:todo ("SOMEDAY" "TO-READ" "CHECK" "TO-WATCH" "WATCHING")
                     ;; Show this group at the end of the agenda (since it has the
                     ;; highest number). If you specified this group last, items
                     ;; with these todo keywords that e.g. have priority A would be
                     ;; displayed in that group instead, because items are grouped
                     ;; out in the order the groups are listed.
                     :order 9)
              (:priority<= "B"
                           ;; Show this section after "Today" and "Important", because
                           ;; their order is unspecified, defaulting to 0. Sections
                           ;; are displayed lowest-number-first.
                           :order 1)
              ;; After the last group, the agenda will display items that didn't
              ;; match any of these groups, with the default order position of 99
              )))
       (org-agenda nil "a"))

   The groups apply to all agenda commands (at least, every one that
calls ‘org-agenda-finalize-entries’).  You can set different groups for
custom commands by setting ‘org-super-agenda-groups’ in the custom
command’s ‘settings’ list (see the description for
‘org-agenda-custom-commands’).  You can disable grouping by binding
‘org-agenda-super-groups’ to nil around a call to an agenda command, or
you can disable it globally by disabling the mode.


File: README.info,  Node: Group selectors,  Next: Tips,  Prev: Examples,  Up: Usage

5.2 Group selectors
===================

Each group selector takes an argument which can be a single atom or a
list, e.g.  ‘:tag’ takes a string or list of strings.  Some selectors
are predicates, like ‘:deadline’ or ‘:habit’; for consistency, they also
take an argument, but it is ignored.

   A group selector creates a section in the agenda containing the items
it matches, and any items it doesn’t match are passed to the next group
selector.

   ‘:discard’ is a special exception to this: it simply discards any
items it matches, and passes through the rest to the next group
selector.

   Note that the ‘:not’ group selector _creates_ a group with items it
_does not_ match; it can be combined with ‘:discard’ to discard items
that _don’t_ match, e.g.  ‘(:discard (:not (:priority "A")))’ as the
first selector would mean that only priority ‘A’ items would appear in
the agenda, while ‘(:discard (:priority "C"))’ would mean that any
priority ‘C’ items would not appear in the agenda.

File: README.info,  Node: Keywords,  Next: Special selectors,  Up: Group selectors

5.2.1 Keywords
--------------

‘:name’
     Optionally, set group name header.  May be a string; or the symbol
     ‘none’, in which case no header will be inserted.  If ‘:name’ is
     not set at all, the group will be named automatically.


File: README.info,  Node: Special selectors,  Next: Normal selectors,  Prev: Keywords,  Up: Group selectors

5.2.2 Special selectors
-----------------------

Every selector requires an argument, even if it’s just ‘t’, e.g.
‘:anything’, ‘:auto-category’, ‘:auto-group’, and ‘:discard’.

‘:and’
     Group ITEMS that match all selectors in GROUP.
‘:anything’
     Select every item, no matter what.  This is probably most useful
     with ‘:discard’, because it doesn’t actually test anything, so it’s
     faster than, e.g.  ‘:regexp "."’, which has to get the entry text
     for every item.
‘:auto-category’
     This automatically groups items by their category (usually the
     filename it’s in, without the .org suffix).
‘:auto-group’
     This selects items that have the agenda-group Org property set.  By
     setting this property for a subtree, every item in it will be
     sorted into an agenda group by that name and placed into the agenda
     where the ‘:auto-group’ selector is ().
‘:discard’
     Discard items that don’t match selectors.  Any groups processed
     after this one will not see discarded items.  You might use this at
     the beginning or end of a list of groups, either to narrow down the
     list of items (used in combination with ‘:not’), or to exclude
     items you’re not interested in.
‘:not’
     Group ITEMS that match no selectors in GROUP.
‘:order’
     A number setting the order sections will be displayed in the
     agenda, lowest number first.  Defaults to 0.
‘:order-multi’
     Set the order of multiple groups at once, like ‘(:order-multi (2
     (groupA) (groupB) ...))’ to set the order of these groups to 2.


File: README.info,  Node: Normal selectors,  Prev: Special selectors,  Up: Group selectors

5.2.3 Normal selectors
----------------------

These selectors take one argument alone, or multiple arguments in a
list.

‘:category’
     Group items that match any of the given categories.  Argument may
     be a string or list of strings.
‘:children’
     Select any item that has child entries.  Argument may be ‘t’ to
     match if it has any children, ‘nil’ to match if it has no children,
     ‘todo’ to match if it has children with any to-do keywords, or a
     string to match if it has children with certain to-do keywords.
     You might use this to select items that are project top-level
     headings.  Be aware that this may be very slow in non-daily/weekly
     agenda views because of its recursive nature.
‘:date’
     Group items that have a date associated.  Argument can be t to
     match items with any date, nil to match items without a date, or
     today to match items with today’s date.  The ts-date text-property
     is matched against.
‘:deadline’
     Group items that have a deadline.  Argument can be ‘t’ (to match
     items with any deadline), ‘nil’ (to match items that have no
     deadline), ‘past’ (to match items with a deadline in the past),
     ‘today’ (to match items whose deadline is today), or ‘future’ (to
     match items with a deadline in the future).  Argument may also be
     given like ‘before DATE’ or ‘after DATE’ where DATE is a date
     string that ‘org-time-string-to-absolute’ can process.
‘:effort<’
     Group items that are less than (or equal to) the given effort.
     Argument is a time-duration string, like ‘5’ or ‘0:05’ for 5
     minutes.
‘:effort>’
     Group items that are higher than (or equal to) the given effort.
     Argument is a time-duration string, like ‘5’ or ‘0:05’ for 5
     minutes.
‘:habit’
     Group habit items (items which have a STYLE: habit Org property).
‘:heading-regexp’
     Group items whose headings match any of the given regular
     expressions.
‘:log’
     Group Agenda Log Mode items.  Argument may be ‘close’ or ‘closed’
     to select items closed today; ‘clock’ or ‘clocked’ to select items
     clocked today; ‘changed’ or ‘state’ to select items whose to-do
     state was changed today; ‘t’ to select any logged item, or ‘nil’ to
     select any non-logged item.  (See also variable
     ‘org-agenda-log-mode-items’.)  Note that these items may also be
     matched by the ‘:time-grid’ selector, so if you want these
     displayed in their own group, you may need to select them in a
     group before a group containing the ‘:time-grid’ selector.
‘:priority’
     Group items that match any of the given priorities.  Argument may
     be a string or list of strings, which should be the priority
     letter, e.g.  ‘A’.
‘:priority>’
     Group items that are higher than the given priority, e.g.  ‘C’.
‘:priority>=’
     Group items that are higher than or equal to the given priority,
     e.g.  ‘B’.
‘:priority<’
     Group items that are lower than the given priority, e.g.  ‘A’.
‘:priority<=’
     Group items that are lower than or equal to the given priority,
     e.g.  ‘B’.
‘:regexp’
     Group items that match any of the given regular expressions.
‘:scheduled’
     Group items that are scheduled.  Argument can be ‘t’ (to match
     items scheduled for any date), ‘nil’ (to match items that are not
     schedule), ‘past’ (to match items scheduled for the past), ‘today’
     (to match items scheduled for today), or ‘future’ (to match items
     scheduled for the future).  Argument may also be given like ‘before
     DATE’ or ‘after DATE’ where DATE is a date string that
     ‘org-time-string-to-absolute’ can process.
‘:tag’
     Group items that match any of the given tags.  Argument may be a
     string or list of strings.
‘:time-grid’
     Group items that appear on the time grid.
‘:todo’
     Group items that match any of the given TODO keywords.  Argument
     may be a string or list of strings, or ‘t’ to match any keyword, or
     ‘nil’ to match only non-todo items.

5.3 Tips
========

   • An *note info page: (org-super-agenda)Top. is included, with the
     contents of this readme file.
   • Group headers use the keymap org-super-agenda-header-map, allowing
     you to bind keys in that map which will take effect when point is
     on a header.
        • For example, origami
          (https://github.com/gregsexton/origami.el) works with
          org-super-agenda buffers without any extra configuration.
          Just activate origami-mode in the agenda buffer and use the
          command origami-toggle-node to fold groups.  You can bind,
          e.g.  TAB to that command in the header map, and then you can
          easily collapse groups as if they were an outline.  You might
          even fold some automatically ().

7.1 Bugs
========

   • The org-search-view agenda command does not seem to set the
     todo-state text property for items it finds, so the :todo selector
     doesn’t work with it.  We should be able to work around this by
     getting the todo state for each item manually, but we have to make
     sure that we only do that when necessary, otherwise it might be
     slow.  And I wouldn’t be surprised if there are other selectors
     that don’t work with this or other commands, but org-agenda-list
     should work fine, and org-tags-view and org-todo-list seem to work.
